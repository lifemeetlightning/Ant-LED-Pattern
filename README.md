# FastLED Ant Pattern

This project contains the code from my original Ant LED Youtube video tutorial as well as the improved code from my BETTER Ant LED tutorial video:

## Overview

The original Ant LED pattern contains a startup section that populates a moving chaser/ant pattern down the WS2812b light strip, and then continues marching the ants! 

The improved code from the "BETTER Ant LED" tutorial, does not contain the startup section from the original code, but contains an array that can be manipulate to create any kind of custom pattern of lights to move down the light strip. The direction of the lights can also be switched by push button input.

## Features

- Can be modified for different lengths of light strips as well as different block and gap sizes and colors.
- Start up section of code can be bypassed to simplify things when use longer light strips.
- Improved code can switch directions and be customized for asynchronous light patterns and colors.
