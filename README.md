# FastLED Ant Pattern

This project contains the code from my original Ant LED Youtube video tutorial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50UeB2GqU-4

## Overview

This Ant LED pattern contains a startup section that populates a moving chaser/ant pattern down the WS2812b light strip, and then continues marching the ants! 

## Features

- Can be modified for different lengths of light strips as well as different block and gap sizes and colors (see tutorial video linked above).
- Start up section of code can be bypassed to simplify things when use longer light strips.
