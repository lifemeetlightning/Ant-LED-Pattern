This project contains the code from my original Ant LED Youtube video tutorial as well as the improved code from my BETTER Ant LED tutorial video:

## Overview

The original Ant LED pattern contains a startup section that populates a moving chaser/ant pattern down the WS2812b light strip, and then continues marching the ants! The improved code from the "BETTER Ant LED" tutorial, does not contain the startup section from the original code, but  

## Features

- Can be modified for different lengths of light strips as well as different block and gap sizes and colors (see tutorial video linked above).
- Start up section of code can be bypassed to simplify things when use longer light strips.
